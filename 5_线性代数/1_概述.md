* **1.2 向量（Vector）**
  * A vector v is a set of numbers
    * $\vec{v} = \left \{ \begin{matrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right \}$​
    * components : the entries of a vector
      * The i-th component of vector v refers to v_i
      * v_1 = 1, v_2 = 2, v_3 = 3
  * 运算
    * Scalar Multiplication
      * $c\vec{v}$
    * Vector Addition
      * $\vec{a}+\vec{b} = \{a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2\}$
    * Vector Set
      * $\{\vec{a},\ \vec{b},\ \vec{c},\ \vec{d}\}$​
      * $R^n$ : We denote the set of all vectors with n entries
  * 特性
    * For any vector u, v and w in R^n, and any scalars a and b
    * u + v = v + u
    * (u + v ) + w = u + (v + w)
    * There is an element 0 in R^n such that 0 + u = u
    * There is an element u' in R^n such that u' + u = 0
      * 0 = {0 ... 0} zero vector
      * u' is the additive inverse of u
    * 1u = u
    * (ab)u = a(bu)
    * a(u + v) = au + av
    * (a + b)u = au + bu

* **1.3 矩阵（Matrix）**

  * A matrix is a set of vectors

    * $\{\vec{a},\ \vec{b},\ \vec{c},\ \vec{d}\}$

    * If the matrix has m rows and n columns, we say the size of the matrix is m by n, written m x n

      * The matrix is called square if m = n
      * we use M_{mxn} to denote the set that contains all matrices whose size is m x n

    * Index of component : the scalar in the i-th row and j-th column is called (i, j)-entry of the matrix (先 row 后 column)
      $$
      A = 
      \left \{ \begin{matrix}
      2\ 3\ 5 \\
      3\ 1\ -1 \\
      -2\ 1\ 1 \\
      \end{matrix} \right \}
      $$

  * 运算

    * Two matrices with the same size can add or subtract
    * Matrix can multiply by a scalar

  * Zero Matrix

    * A + O = A
    * OA = O
    * A - A = 0

  * 特性

    * A, B, C are m x n matrices, and s and t are scalars
      * A + B = B + A
      * (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
      * (st)A = S(sA)
      * s(A + B) = sA + sB
      * (s + t)A = sA + tA

  * Transpose

    * If A is an m x n matrix
    * A^T (transpose of A) is an m x n matrix whose (i, j)-entry is the (j-i)-entry of A
    * 特性
      * A and B are m x n matrices, and s is a scalar
        * $(A^T)^T = A$​
        * $(sA)^T = sA^T$
        * $(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T$
