#### 3.栈（Stack）

* ##### 3.1 概述

  * Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)

  * (Constant-time) operations:
  
    * insertTop (data), often called push (data)
    * removeTop (), often called pop ()
    * getTop (), often called peek ()
  
  * 应用
  
    * Parentheses Balancing Algorithm
  
      ```Pseudo Code
      for each c in the input do
      	if c is a left character
      		push c to the stack
      	else if c is a right character
      		pop d drom the stack and check if match
      	end if
      end for
      ```
  
    * Postfix Evaluation
    
      ```pseudocode
      for each token in the input do
      	if token is a number
      		push token to the stack
      	else if token is an operator
      		sequentially pop operands at-1, ..., a0 from the stack
      		push token(a0, a1, at-1) to the stack
      	end if
      end for
      return the top of stack
      ```
    
    * Infix-Postfix Translation
    
      ```pseudocode
      for each token in the input do
      	if token is a number
      		output token 
      	else if token is an operator
      		while top of stack is of higher (or same) precedence do
      			pop and output top of stack
      		end while
      		push token to the stack
      	end if
      end for
      ```
